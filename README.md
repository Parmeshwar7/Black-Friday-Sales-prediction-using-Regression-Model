Introduction
This project aims to predict the sales of products during Black Friday using various regression models. By analyzing historical sales data, the project identifies key factors influencing sales and builds a predictive model to estimate future sales during Black Friday.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Black Friday Dataset, which contains purchase data from a retail store. The dataset includes customer demographics, product details, and purchase amounts.

Features:
User ID
Product ID
Gender
Age
Occupation
City Category
Stay in Current City Years
Marital Status
Product Category 1, 2, 3
Purchase Amount
Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

Python 3.x
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Jupyter Notebook (for interactive exploration)
You can install the required libraries using:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Implementation
The project follows these steps:

# Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualizing relationships between features and the target variable
Identifying correlations and feature importance
Model Building:

Regression models used: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV
Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE, MAE, and R^2.
Model Selection and Testing:

Comparing different models based on performance metrics
Selecting the best model for final predictions
Model Performance
The selected model achieved the following performance on the test set:

RMSE: [Your Value]
MAE: [Your Value]
R^2: [Your Value]
Include visualizations such as learning curves, feature importance plots, and residual plots to illustrate model performance.

# How to Use
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction.git
cd Black-Friday-Sales-Prediction
Run the Jupyter notebooks:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook notebooks/Data_Exploration.ipynb
Predict on new data:
Use the model.py script to predict sales on new data:

bash
# code
python src/model.py --input data/test.csv --output predictions.csv
Results
The project successfully predicts Black Friday sales with a high degree of accuracy. The best-performing model was [Model Name], which demonstrated strong predictive power on unseen data.
